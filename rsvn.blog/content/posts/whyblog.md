### My Commonplace

> “Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.”  
> — *David Allen*

Our brain consumes far more information than we can handle — and often, we forget things( these are the words form the book **bulidng a  second brain**)  

So, I wanted to make my learning **structured** — something easily maintainable, reachable, and organized.

This is *my commonplace* — a space to store the information I gather and interpret in my own perspective and can be accesed from any where just with internet connection.

I have written many personal notes from blogs, books, and video tutorials. But physical notes are hard to maintain and carry around.  
Then I discovered the process of **generating web pages from Markdown** — and Markdown is incredibly simple.
right now i'm using hugo (a static site generator written in go) now all i have to do is write the info in md formate and generate html files with single cmd and push it on git hub
which will magically update my repo  

Static blogs require minimal resources to host since their only job is to serve prebuilt HTML files on client requests — unlike dynamic pages, they’re lightweight and cache easily.
and with git hub pages i dont need even a server to host how awesome is that i can do this with out spending a ruppe :)

I’m a nobody — just someone interested in **computers**, **operating systems**, **web**, **servers**,**backend-systems**,**games**, and **low-level tech**.  
and i wanna be more Tech-savvy of a person
I want to share and record the information I find valuable and express it for myself.

I’m publishing these blogs because I want to **journal the process of learning** — that way, I can look back and see how I’ve grown over time.  
I’m not expecting anyone to read them — they’re simply my record of learning and reflection.
